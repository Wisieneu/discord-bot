# Misery, the Discord Bot
### Invite Misery to Your Discord Server using <strong><a href='https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1034298739852050463&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands'>This Link</a></strong>
A simple Discord Bot with (so far) very basic features  
Will be developed into a very extensive app later on  

## Features available so far:  
- Descriptive message logging  
- Responding with a certain message if the user message contains a certain keyword (for example: bot responds with a link to a <strong><a href='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/654594751433146378/1033767835199078431/41ce545e2c093bcbf4461c459b4f4dec.mp4'>[video]</a></strong> if the message contains 'baller' in it) - used for some inside jokes on my private server for personal use, but you can easily modify the phrase list for your use.
- Responding to commands trigerred inside Discord itself - their list can be accessed by executing `m!help`. Its output will be printed below:
>*m!help -> Prints this page  
>m!joke -> Prints a random joke (taken from various APIs)*  
>...with more to come
