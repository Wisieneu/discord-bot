# Misery, the Discord Bot
A simple Discord Bot with (so far) very basic features  
Will be developed into a very extensive app later on  

### Features available so far:  
- Responding with a certain message if the user message contains a certain keyword (for example: bot responds with a link to a <strong><a href='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/654594751433146378/1033767835199078431/41ce545e2c093bcbf4461c459b4f4dec.mp4'>[video]</a></strong> if the message contains 'baller' in it) - used for some inside jokes on my private server for personal use, but you can easily modify it for yourself.
- Responding to commands trigerred inside Discord itself - their list can be accessed by executing the `help` command after inviting Misery to your server (example: m!joke returns a random joke, which comes as a request from an external API)
